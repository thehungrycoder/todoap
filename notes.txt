- Docker may need more config to automatically sync after edit. Currently, it's designed to run only (not for active development)
- Deliberately avoided jsdoc for many functions/methods for the sake of time
- Incoming data validation/validation middlewares are not added for the sake of time
- Dup id fields (one with underscore); in real life we want to avoid one (mostly like _id)
- Currently to mark a task completed, we'll just use the PUT /tasks/<id> for now. Also we'll need to validate value of the field, along with current status of the object (like if already completed, raise error)
- committed .env for aid of running it though not recommended.
- functional tests may currently have side effects which means, one test may depend on previous test. in real world this must be avoided, but here it exists to reduce prep for each test.
- this repo uses `config` npm module. ideally, app will be run in production model and `production.json` will be written with another process like ansible so that the prod credentials are not inside project.
