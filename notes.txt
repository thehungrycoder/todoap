- Docker may need more config to automatically sync after edit. Currently, it's designed to run only (not for active development)
- Deliberately avoided jsdoc for many functions/methods for the sake of time
- Incoming data validation/validation middlewares are not added for the sake of time
- Dup id fields (one with underscore); in real life we want to avoid one (mostly like _id)
- Currently to mark a task completed, we'll just use the PUT /tasks/<id> for now. Also we'll need to validate value of the field, along with current status of the object (like if already completed, raise error)
